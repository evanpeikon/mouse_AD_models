This folder contains the processed data, intermediate files, and final results generated during the project. The contents are organized as into sub-directories as follows:

- counts_lists: This folder includes cleaned gene expression data for the 5xFAD and 3xTG-AD mouse models and their corresponding wild-type controls. The data files contain raw expression counts annotated with Ensembl IDs and corresponding gene names. (Counts lists refer to tables of read counts for each gene, serving as the foundation for downstream analyses.)

- filtered_normalized: This folder contains the filtered and normalized gene expression data for the 5xFAD and 3xTG-AD mouse models. These datasets are processed to remove noise and standardize expression levels, preparing them for analysis.

- DEA_results: This folder holds the results of the differential expression analysis performed on the PS3O1S mouse model. These files provide insights into genes showing significant expression changes in this model.

- DEG: This folder contains lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified across all three mouse models: 5xFAD, 3xTG-AD, and PS3O1S. These files summarize key findings from the project.
