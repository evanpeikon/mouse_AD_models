# ðŸ§¬ Introduction
## Overview

The purpose of this project is to explore the similarities, differences, and overlapping featuresâ€”including differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Gene Ontology (GO) terms, biological pathways, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networksâ€”between three mutant mouse models of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). This analysis forms part of a larger initiative aimed at understanding overlapping molecular features between Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and spaceflight-related neurodegeneration. Ultimately, this work seeks to leverage both human and rodent research to identify potential methods for enhancing resilience against neurodegenerative conditions.

The immediate focus of this project is on establishing which rodent AD models best recapitulate the neurodegenerative conditions associated with space exposure. Achieving this objective is crucial before extending the analysis to include additional AD mouse models, different tissue types, and mice subjected to actual spaceflight.

If successful, this project will serve as a springboard for broader investigations into the molecular and functional connections between Alzheimerâ€™s pathology and space-associated neurodegeneration. This could pave the way for novel interventions aimed at bolstering brain resilience both on Earth and in space.

This repository is structured into five main sections:
- Introduction: Provides an overview and scientific background for the project.
- Project Staging: Details project dependencies, data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), quality control, filtering, and normalization steps.
- Analyses: Includes differential expression analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and PPI network analysis. Summarizations of the results for each analysis are also provided here.
- Results and Discussion: Synthesizes the results from all analyses and discusses their broader biological context and implications.
- Reproducibility: Explains how to reproduce all the analyses using the provided Docker images and scripts.

## Scientific Background

Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by hallmark pathologies such as amyloid-Î² plaques, tau protein tangles, synaptic dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. While mice do not naturally develop Alzheimerâ€™s Disease, transgenic mouse models have been developed to recapitulate key pathological features of the disease, enabling researchers to study its underlying mechanisms and evaluate potential therapeutic interventions.

In this project, we focus on three widely used AD mouse models:
- 5xFAD: This model carries five familial AD mutations across APP (amyloid precursor protein) and PSEN1 (presenilin-1) genes. It exhibits aggressive amyloid-Î² plaque deposition, neuronal loss, and gliosis at an early age, making it an ideal model for studying amyloid pathology.
- 3xTG-AD: This triple transgenic model carries mutations in APP, PSEN1, and MAPT (tau). It develops both amyloid plaques and tau tangles, as well as cognitive impairments, providing a more comprehensive representation of AD pathology.
- PS3O1S: This model harbors mutations in presenilin-1 and other associated genes. It exhibits a slower progression of amyloid-Î² accumulation and may provide insights into early molecular changes associated with AD.

This project is significant not only for Alzheimerâ€™s research but also for understanding the phenomenon of space-associated neurodegeneration, often referred to as "space brain." Extended exposure to microgravity and cosmic radiation has been linked to changes in brain structure, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and cognitive impairments in astronauts. These effects share striking parallels with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s.

To identify mutual features between AD and space-associated neurodegeneration, it is essential to determine which rodent models best reflect the "space brain" condition. By comparing the molecular and functional features of these AD models, we aim to pinpoint those that most closely align with the neurodegenerative changes observed in space-flown mice. This work could provide a foundation for developing countermeasures to protect against neurodegeneration in space exploration and in clinical settings on Earth.
